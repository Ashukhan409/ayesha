    <h1>The Role of Technology in Human Resources</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      In today's digital age, technology is revolutionizing every sector — including Human Resources (HR). From recruitment to employee engagement, HR departments are increasingly relying on modern tools to streamline their processes and enhance decision-making.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Recruitment and Hiring</h2>
    <p>
      Technology enables automated applicant tracking systems (ATS), AI-based candidate screening, and online assessments, reducing manual workload and ensuring better candidate matches.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Employee Onboarding</h2>
    <p>
      With digital onboarding platforms, new hires can complete paperwork, training, and orientation remotely, leading to a smoother and faster integration into the company.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Performance Management</h2>
    <p>
      Real-time feedback tools and performance tracking software help managers evaluate employees more effectively and foster a culture of continuous improvement.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Training and Development</h2>
    <p>
      E-learning platforms and virtual workshops make it easier for employees to upgrade their skills at their own pace, regardless of location.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data-Driven Decision Making</h2>
    <p>
      HR analytics allow organizations to gain insights from workforce data, helping leaders make strategic decisions about hiring, retention, and employee engagement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, the integration of technology in HR is not just a trend — it's a transformation. It allows HR professionals to shift from administrative tasks to strategic roles that directly impact organizational success.
